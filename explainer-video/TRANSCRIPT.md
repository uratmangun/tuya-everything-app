"Introducing the AI Smart Doorbell - powered by Tuya T5AI.

Current smart doorbells have major problems. Ring and Nest lock you into their ecosystem with proprietary cameras. You're paying three to twelve dollars every month. And advanced AI features? Those cost extra.

We built something different. An open-source, AI-powered doorbell with zero subscription fees.

Connect any camera you already own. Our AI detects and identifies visitors instantly. Talk to anyone at your door from anywhere in the world. And when you're busy? The AI responds for you automatically.

Here's how it works. A visitor presses the doorbell button. The T5AI DevKit instantly alerts your VPS server. The AI captures the camera feed and identifies who's there. Then you can respond from your phone - or let the AI handle it.

Built on the Tuya T5AI development board with WiFi and audio capabilities. Backed by a Node.js server. Powered by YOLO for detection and GPT for conversations.
