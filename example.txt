Project Plan for T5-Based AI
Multi-Functional Desktop Device
I. Project Overview
1.1 Project Background
In the current wave of global intelligence, desktop smart devices have deeply
integrated into office and home scenarios, becoming an indispensable part of
people's daily life and work. According to IDC's 2024 Smart Hardware Market

Report, the global desktop smart device market is showing vigorous growth,
with the scale expected to surpass USD 30 billion in 2025 and a compound
annual growth rate of 23.5%. Among these, the demand for multi-functional
integrated devices is growing even faster, significantly higher than
single-function products, with the former growing at 37% and the latter at only
18%. This data clearly indicates that the market's desire for desktop devices that
integrate multiple functions is becoming increasingly strong.
However, current desktop smart devices have obvious pain points. Most
products focus on a single function, such as only having health reminder
functionality, or serving merely as a calendar and note-taking tool. This forces
users to purchase multiple devices to meet their comprehensive needs, which
not only occupies a large amount of desktop space but also makes operation
extremely cumbersome, seriously affecting user experience.

This project keenly captures this market gap and user pain points. Relying on the
excellent performance of the Tuya T5 development board, we boldly innovate
and are committed to integrating AI interaction, health management, and
calendar scheduling into a single device. Through a carefully designed modular
hardware architecture and continuously optimized software algorithms, we aim
to create a revolutionary product capable of “solving multiple scenario needs
with one device”, filling the market gap and bringing users an unprecedented
convenient and efficient experience. During project implementation, AI
technology will be fully leveraged—from the demand analysis stage to
accurately grasp user pain points, to the design phase using AI to optimize
hardware layout and software architecture, and then to testing relying on AI for
efficient performance evaluation and problem diagnosis—fully enhancing
project implementation efficiency and product quality.

II. Market Analysis
2.1 Market Demand (Data Support)

Office Scenario: LinkedIn workplace survey data shows that 83% of
white-collar workers have a sedentary problem, with daily sedentary time
exceeding 6 hours; 65% of white-collar workers often forget to drink water due
to busy work. Additionally, 72% of office workers urgently hope that desktop
devices can have “information aggregation + health management” composite
functions to meet their diverse needs during busy work. Introducing AI smart
office assistant functionality can, based on office data such as emails and
document contents, intelligently remind users of important work arrangements,
further improving work efficiency and health care.

2.3 Market Competitive Advantage (Benchmark Analysis)

III. Technical Plan
3.1 Hardware Design
1.

Sensor Modules: Select high-precision sensors to provide accurate data

for device orientation. AI algorithms analyze and process the data collected by
sensors in real-time to improve accuracy and stability.

2.

Processing Unit: The Tuya T5 development board is the core, with strong

computing power to efficiently process multi-sensor data. AI optimizes the
development board's resource scheduling, ensuring smooth system operation
during multitasking, such as performing AI chat while not affecting the real-time
nature of health monitoring.

3.

Display and Interaction Module: Equipped with a high-resolution display for

presenting calendar information, health data, plant care suggestions, and other
information, providing users with an intuitive interface. Integrated touch control
and voice interaction enable natural communication with the device, utilizing AI

speech recognition and synthesis technologies, allowing users to quickly query
schedules and obtain health suggestions through voice commands.

3.2 Software Architecture

3.

AI Algorithm Integration: Introduce advanced natural language processing

algorithms for AI chat functionality to improve the accuracy and intelligence of
language understanding and responses. Apply machine learning algorithms to
model and analyze health monitoring data, soil data, etc., realizing deep data
mining and application, such as generating personalized health improvement
plans based on the user's historical health data.
