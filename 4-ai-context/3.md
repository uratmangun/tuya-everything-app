### User Input

@[what/2.md] this is what we've done so far please continue fix the audio issue

*Viewed [2.md](file:///home/uratmangun/CascadeProjects/TuyaOpen/what/2.md) *

### Planner Response

Now let me check the current state of `tuya_main.c` to see what changes were made and understand the current audio implementation:

*Viewed [tuya_main.c](file:///home/uratmangun/CascadeProjects/TuyaOpen/apps/tuya_cloud/object_detection/src/tuya_main.c) *

### Planner Response

Let me also check the alert audio data and the audio player implementation to understand the audio format:

*Viewed [alert_audio_data.h](file:///home/uratmangun/CascadeProjects/TuyaOpen/apps/tuya_cloud/object_detection/src/alert_audio_data.h) *

*Analyzed [ai_audio_main.c](file:///home/uratmangun/CascadeProjects/TuyaOpen/apps/tuya.ai/ai_components/ai_audio/src/ai_audio_main.c) *

*Analyzed [ai_audio_player.c](file:///home/uratmangun/CascadeProjects/TuyaOpen/apps/tuya.ai/ai_components/ai_audio/src/ai_audio_player.c) *

### Planner Response

Let me check the [ai_audio_set_volume](cci:1://file:///home/uratmangun/CascadeProjects/TuyaOpen/apps/tuya.ai/ai_components/ai_audio/src/ai_audio_main.c:308:0-325:1) function and also look at the alert audio data file to understand what format it's in. Let me also check the monitor output to see what errors might be occurring:

*Viewed code item*

*Searched filesystem*

*Read terminal output: monitor*

### Planner Response

Let me check the actual terminal output from the running monitors:

*User accepted the command `ps aux | grep -i monitor`*

*Viewed [alert_audio_data.c](file:///home/uratmangun/CascadeProjects/TuyaOpen/apps/tuya_cloud/object_detection/src/alert_audio_data.c) *
